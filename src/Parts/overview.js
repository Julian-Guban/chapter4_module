          Setting-up computer servers is a vital process for ensuring the smooth
          functioning of networked environments, especially in Local Area
          Networks (LANs) and Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) systems. This unit
          emphasizes the key skills needed to configure and deploy servers,
          which include establishing user access, configuring network services,
          conducting testing and documentation, and carrying out pre-deployment
          procedures. Learners will develop proficiency in defining user access
          levels, implementing network policies and services, and managing
          peerto-peer (P2P) network access. Furthermore, the unit addresses
          server modules and add-ons, operations of network services, and
          strategies for managing unexpected incidents. There is a strong focus
          on enterprise policies and testing procedures, documenting reports and
          findings, and ensuring security compliance prior to deployment. This
          unit also promotes analytical thinking, problem-solving, and technical
          skills, while fostering effective communication, adaptability,
          self-motivation, and teamwork that is crucial skills in the industry
          standards. By mastering these skills, the learners will be
          well-prepared to set up and maintain servers, ensuring seamless
          connectivity, security, and efficiency across various computing
          environments.
